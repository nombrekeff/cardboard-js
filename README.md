**Cardboard.js: Build web apps without HTML, CSS, or JSX!** This lightweight (_around 18kb_), performant framework lets you manage state, components, and logic using just JavaScript/TypeScript.  Ideal for projects where simplicity and speed are key.

It's similar in philosophy to [VanJS](https://vanjs.org/), but with many more features and a more extensive API.

> You can check the [v1.0.0 milestone](https://github.com/nombrekeff/cardboard-js/milestone/1) for a view on the development state - **help is much appreciated!**

<!-- Welcome to Cardboard. An **extremely light** (_around **18kb**_), **performant**, and **very simple** reactive framework. It offers almost everything you'd expect from a complete framework. Like managing state, components, logic, and the rest. But with a twist, **you don't need to write any HTML, CSS, or JSX** if you don't want to. See **[what it can do](https://github.com/nombrekeff/cardboard-js#what-does-it-do)**.


It's similar in philosophy to [VanJS](https://vanjs.org/), if that rings a bell, but with many more features, and a more extensive API.

```ts
const Counter = () => {
  const count = state(0);

  return button()
    .text(`Clicked $count times`, { count })
    .addStyle('color', 'gray')
    .stylesIf(count.greaterThan(5), { color: 'red' }) // If count > 5, it will make the color red
    .clicked((_) => count.value++);
};

// Counter will be added to the body
tag('(body)').append(Counter());
```

### What does it do?

Cardboard.js lets you create web apps using only JavaScript/TypeScript, eliminating the need for HTML, CSS, or JSX. Write code that directly represents your HTML, CSS, state, and logic.

**Key features:**
*   **[NO HTML](https://github.com/nombrekeff/cardboard-js/wiki/Tags)**: Create any HTML element with Cardboard.
*   **[State](https://github.com/nombrekeff/cardboard-js/wiki/State)**: Built-in reactive state management.
*   **[Manipulation](https://github.com/nombrekeff/cardboard-js/wiki/Manipulating-Tags)**: Easily manipulate HTML properties based on state.
*   **[Logic](https://github.com/nombrekeff/cardboard-js/wiki/Logic)**: Add application logic in a simple way.
*   **[Text Templates](https://github.com/nombrekeff/cardboard-js/wiki/Text-Templates)**: Simplify text and template manipulation with state.
*   **[Components](https://github.com/nombrekeff/cardboard-js/wiki/Reusable-Component)**: Create reusable UI components.
*   **[Tweening](https://github.com/nombrekeff/cardboard-js/wiki/Tweening)**: Simple tweening animations.
*   **[Routing](https://github.com/nombrekeff/cardboard-js/wiki/Routing)**: Build single-page applications with ease.
*   **[CSS in JS](#css-in-js)**: Style your application using JavaScript objects.
*   **Typed**: Full TypeScript support for code completion and type safety.
*   **ATAP**: As tested as possible!

> NOTE: There's also a server-side alternative to **Cardboard** I've also written, called [**Hobo**](https://github.com/nombrekeff/hobo-js). In case you need something similar to Cardboard that works server-side!
> I'm planning to make Cardboard work server-side as well in v2.0.0. So you can look forward to that, or help out!
